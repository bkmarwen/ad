This project involves analyzing data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), a survey sponsored by the US Federal Reserve. The SCF tracks financial, demographic, and opinion information about families in the United States. The survey is conducted every three years, and this project uses an extract of the results from 2019.

## Conclusion

Our findings showed that younger, low-income households were more likely to be worried about being approved for credit. We also found that white/non-Hispanic households were more likely to be in the credit fearful group, while black and Hispanic households were more likely to be in this group as well.

We also found that credit fearful households had lower incomes and were more likely to have only a high school diploma. In terms of debt, we discovered that the main source of debt for credit fearful households was their primary residence.

Overall, our analysis gave us a deeper understanding of the financial struggles and challenges faced by households that have been denied credit in the past. This information will be valuable in informing policy decisions and helping to improve the financial well-being of these households.
